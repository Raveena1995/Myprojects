Hi, I'm Raveena 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻
  I'm a graduate student who is passionate about making contributing and building community. My major is in computer science with a concentration in Data science and Machine Learning. This is my github page where I try to showcase few of my projects and their outputs(Also, few of the projects have a video description of what the project is about 📹). Thank you for considering to look at them.
